This is a university project being developed by a BCA student of Tribhuvan University.

This project aims to keep record of the transection that occurs in our daily life.
Anyone can update their borrowing or lending money in the site. Every user will get a
personalized profile with only their data in it.

As a begining phase project this site may not have every feature that a client wants, but 
will be updated on further updates.
